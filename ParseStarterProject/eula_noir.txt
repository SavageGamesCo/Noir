17.	BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE VALIDITY, APPLICABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT (EACH, A “CLAIM”), SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-applicable rules, including (as appropriate) its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at http://www.adr.org/. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by a single independent and neutral arbitrator. For any hearing conducted in person as part of the arbitration, you agree that the hearing will be conducted in the County and State of New York or the city in the United States in which you reside. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. Judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Before submitting a Claim to arbitration pursuant to this Section 17, you must first submit the Claim to Savage Code, LLC for informal resolution through noir@savage-code.com or another mechanism specified by Savage Code, LLC. You and Savage Code, LLC agree to work in good faith to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days. If you and Savage Code, LLC are unable to resolve the Claim informally within sixty (60) days, then we each may submit the Claim to arbitration.
If you reject the last written settlement offer made by Savage Code, LLC before the arbitrator was appointed and the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than this last written settlement offer, then Savage Code, LLC will pay: (i) the greater of the award or $500; (ii) your filing fees for the arbitration; and (iii) any fees, costs and expenses deemed appropriate by the arbitrator.
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR ARBITRATION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT SUCH CLAIM SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR, IF FEDERAL JURISDICTION IS NOT AVAILABLE, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY. YOU HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS OF VENUE, FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR GROUNDS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you and Savage Code, LLC may seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect our intellectual property rights, whether in aid of, pending or independently of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth above.
18.	General. (a) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its unenforceability. Such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of this Agreement. (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under this agreement to another party without the express written consent of Savage Code, LLC. (c) The failure of either party to require strict performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. (d) The parties acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between you and Savage Code, LLC only, and not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Software and the contents thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Software.
